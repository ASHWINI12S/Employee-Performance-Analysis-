Companies generate a lot of data with regards to their employees. I came upon this employee dataset and decided to visualize it through Excel.

* Project Objective:

create an interactive dashboard to analyse the employee performance indexes and track the core underlying causes of their performance issues (clear indicators of non-performing employees).

* Questions (KPIs):

What percentage of employees are classified as top performers?

How are the employees distributed across performance ratings (Outstanding, Excellent, Good)?

Which job levels have the highest and lowest performance rates?

What is the overall attrition rate of the organization?

How many employees have stayed with the organization versus those who have left?

How many employees participated in training sessions, and what is the average number of training hours per employee?

What is the average job satisfaction score of employees?

What is the average salary hike provided to employees, and how does it vary by performance rating?
How does work-life balance affect employee performance and retention?

Which job roles or levels have the highest performance ratings?

How does attrition differ across departments, job roles, or educational backgrounds?

* Process:
Built an interactive dashboard to track and analyse employee performance.
Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, map, slicers, tables, etc).

* Project Insight:

Performance rate drops to employee with high job level
"overtime done by females =147(31%) and Males =203( 28%); the number of males doing overtime is higher due to more males overall.
Therefore, males are doing more overtime in terms of actual numbers"
Performance rate increase with good work life balance
Devlopment Department have highest performance rate
Attrition rate is high in 28-37 Age group
Devlopers have high attartion rate
Performance is high when employee receive high salary hike

* Conclusion:

Devlopment depmartment should be awarded for great performance
the major cause of employee performance issues is job satisfaction and salary hike percentage
Company can reduce time take for promotions and motivate employee to improve their work life balance
Employee should participate in training programs
Attrition rate can be reduce by offering raise in salary hike
